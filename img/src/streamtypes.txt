[MarshalByRefObject|Enables access to objects across application
domain boundaries in applications 
that support remoting.]

[Stream|Provides a generic view of a sequence of bytes.
This is an abstract class.]

[BufferedStream|Adds a buffering layer to 
read and write operations on another stream.
This class cannot be inherited.]

[BrotliStream|Provides methods and properties used to 
compress and decompress streams by using 
the Brotli data format specification.]

[DeflateStream |Provides methods and properties for 
compressing and decompressing streams 
by using the Deflate algorithm.]

[GZipStream|Provides methods and properties 
used to compress and decompress streams by 
using the GZip data format specification.]

[ZLibStream|Provides methods and properties used
to compress and decompress streams
by using the zlib data format specification.]

[FileStream|Provides a Stream for a file,
supporting both synchronous and
asynchronous read and write operations.]

[MemoryStream|Creates a stream whose
backing store is memory]

[PipeStream|Exposes a Stream object around a pipe, 
which supports both anonymous and named pipes.]

[UnmanagedMemoryStream|Provides access to unmanaged 
blocks of memory from managed code.]

[NetworkStream|Provides the underlying stream 
of data for network access.]

[CryptoStream|Defines a stream that links data
streams to cryptographic transformations.]
